# Vgg19-Pytorch

Customized VGG19 Model (PyTorch)

This project aims to create a customized image classification model using the VGG19 architecture as a foundation, incorporating my own modifications.

Modifications and Features I've Implemented:

Input Layer Adjustments: I tailored the model's input layer to match the data format in my project.
Adding New Layers: I expanded the model according to my needs by appending extra layers to the original architecture of VGG19. (BatchNorm2d)
